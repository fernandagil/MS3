## 1. UX
 
### 1.1. Project Goals
The project's main goal is to have a place where registered users can create, read, update and delete movie reviews.

- They can create a review by clicking on any movie
- They can read a review by clicking on any movie. This can be done by unregistered users as well
- They can update a review by clicking 'edit' on the review in their *Profile Page*
- They can delete a review by clicking 'delete' on the review in their *Profile Page*
 
### 1.2. User Stories
###### General Users
- As a user, I want to immediately understand the purpose of the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to see reviews that other users have created about a movie.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for a movie.
- As a user, I want to be able to suggest new movies to add to the database.
- As a user, I want to see a picture next to the movie title so I can recognise the movie quickly.
- As a user, I want to be able to register easily.

###### Registered Users
- As a registered user, I want to be able to write a review about a movie.
- As a registered user, I want to be able to edit or delete a review I created.
- As a registered user, I want to receive feedback when I made a change successfully.

###### Project Owner / Admin
- As the project owner, I want to be able to add, read, update, and delete movies from the database.
- As the project owner, I want to be able to receive feedback from users so I can add new movies to the database.

### 1.3. Design Choices
- **Fonts**: I chose Raleway as I feel it was an aesthetic and readable font. To emphasize some headers I used Londrina Shadow, since it gave me the feel of a hand drawn header in a diary. Both fonts were imported from (Google Fonts)[https://fonts.google.com/]
- **Movie Posters**: When adding the image of a movie to the database, I filtered the search by usage rights: *Free to share and use*
- **Colours**: to keep consistency through the project, I first selected an [image](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/retro-background-with-film-camera_1023417.htm#page=2&query=movie+background&position=30) to be the main image in the *home page*  and from that image I created the colour palette.

## 4. Testing
 
The testing process can be seen [here](TESTING.md).

## 5. Deployment
 
###### Heroku deployment

Heroku needs some application and dependencies to run the app
1. Create a **requirements.txt** file using the terminal command  `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
2. Create a **Procfile** with the terminal command  `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`.
3. Push these files to GitHub

*The Procfile might add a blank line at the bottom, and sometimes this can cause problems when running our app on Heroku, so just delete that line and save the file.

4. Go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and once you're logged in on your dashboard, click on the **New** button and there click **Create a New App**.
5. Give the new app a name and set the region closest to you, then click the **Create App** 
6. This will take you to the **Deploy** tab of your newly created app. There go to **Deployment method** and select **GitHub**. 
7. In **Connect to GitHub**, search for your repository and click **Connect** to connect it to this app.
8. In the Heroku dashboard for the app, go to **Settings**, and then scroll down and click on **Reveal Config Vars**. Set the following config vars:

|  Key  |  Value  |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
|  IP |  0.0.0.0  |
|  PORT  |  5000  |
|  SECRET_KEY  |  `<your_secret_key>`  |
|  MONGO_URI  | mongodb+srv://`<username>`:`<password>`@`<cluster_name>`-qtxun.mongodb.net/`<database_name>`?retryWrites=true&w=majority  |
|  MONGO_DBNAME  |  `<database name>`  |

9. In the Heroku dashboard for the app, go to **Deploy**, scroll down and click on **Enable Automatic Deployment**
10. Below that select the branch that you want to deploy (in this case *master*) and click **Deploy Branch**
11. Once thatâ€™s done, you can click **View** to launch your app
