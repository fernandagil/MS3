# Testing

## Code validators

#### [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) : 
While testing the HTML code, I had some errors related to Jinja templating. These errors were omitted for the correct functioning of the site. Some examples:

- Home Page
- Search Results Page
- Movie Page
- Edit Review Page
- Register Page
- Log In Page
- Profile Page

- Add New Movie Page
![](readme-files/html-addmovie.jpg)
- Errors 6, 7 and 8 were fixed by ommiting this information since it wasn't necessary for the correct functioning or styling.
- Errors 9 and 10 were fixed by including the missing ID element in the <input> field below the <labels>.

- Edit Movie Page
- 403, 404 and 500 Pages
